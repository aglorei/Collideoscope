# Collideoscope

With some help from Michael Choi, this is a Javascript project that I worked on featuring vector graphics. The page creates dynamic SVG circles from mousedown or touch events and features boundary detection and collision processing with appropriate conservation of momentum using an impulse-based reaction model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response#Impulse-Based_Contact_Model).

Check it out [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response#Impulse-Based_Contact_Model).
